1. import random

The random module is part of Python’s standard library.
It is used to generate random numbers and make random selections.
In games, it helps to create unpredictable outcomes.
You can use random.choice() to select a random item from a list.
random.randint(a, b) returns a random integer between a and b.
random.shuffle() can shuffle elements in a list randomly.
Randomness adds fairness and unpredictability to games.
It is lightweight and easy to use without extra installation.
In our game, it selects 7 random letters from the alphabet.
It ensures each playthrough is unique and different every time.

2. import enchant

enchant is a Python library for spellchecking.
It allows us to verify whether a word exists in a dictionary.
Supports multiple dictionaries like US, UK, Canadian, and Australian English.
The Dict() object is used to create a dictionary instance.
check(word) method returns True if the word is valid.
Useful in word games to prevent players from entering gibberish.
Can be used for autocorrect, grammar checks, and educational apps.
Requires installation via pip install pyenchant.
It helps maintain real-world correctness in word-building games.
Ensures that only meaningful words are counted for scoring.

3. from collections import Counter

collections is a standard Python module with useful data structures.
Counter is a subclass of dictionary in the collections module.
It counts the frequency of each element in a list or string.
Useful for comparing how many times letters appear in a word.
Helps validate that the user does not exceed letter limits.
Counter(word) returns a dictionary-like object with letter counts.
Supports arithmetic operations between counters for comparisons.
Makes code cleaner compared to manually counting letters in loops.
Provides methods like .most_common() to get frequent elements.
Essential for checking valid word formation in our game.

4. import time

The time module is part of Python’s standard library.
It allows access to the system clock and time-related functions.
time.time() returns the current time in seconds since epoch.
Useful for tracking elapsed time in games or programs.
Can implement countdown timers and time-limited challenges.
time.sleep(seconds) pauses program execution for a given time.
Helps make interactive programs more engaging.
Used in our game to implement a 60-second play limit.
Allows real-time game events without blocking user input.
Essential for adding timing mechanics to interactive Python projects.
